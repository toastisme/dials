The DIALS toolkit is designed to allow extension and reuse. DIALS
software is being used in contexts beyond its original focus on
synchrotron X-ray macromolecular crystallography. Here we list some
examples of projects underway that are using DIALS in various ways.

DIALS for neutron diffraction
=============================

The Ada Lovelace Centre is currently funding developments at the
Scientific Computing Department of STFC and at the ISIS Neutron and Muon
Source to adapt DIALS for the time-of-flight (ToF) Laue instrument SXD.

This will enable DIALS to generate scaled intensities from ToF Laue
neutron diffraction data, adding new functionality to work with white
beams, asymmetric, diffuse peak profiles from spallation sources, and
additional algorithms for integration. A work in progress fork is
available `here <https://github.com/toastisme/dials>`_, with plans to
extend this work to monochromatic and quasi-Laue neutron sources in
the future.
